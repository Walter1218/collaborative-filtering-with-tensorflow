# collaborative-filtering-with-tensorflow

This work was inspired by [TF-recomm](https://github.com/songgc/TF-recomm). Rather than forking this repo, I started by refactoring the code to try to conform to the convention used in scikit-learn's `Estimator` (e.g., `fit` and `predict` method, the underscore at the end of learned attributes). 

## Collaborative Filering based on Latent Factor Model

In this formulation, *users* and *items* are mapped to  vectors $p_{u}$ and $q_{i}$ in the same latent factor space $\mathbb{R}$,
